# Ozone_project
A model designed to solve the problem of how ozone concentration is affected by wind speed, air, temperature and intensity of solar radiation.
#### The Model makes use of ozone data labeled "Ozone.txt" in the repo.
* The data was fitted using 4 different models under the same distribution of Normality and the best model was selected based on AIC criterion.
* Furthermore the pearson residuals was calculated for the best model selected and Brudgent test was conducted over 3 different distributions to test for their suitability.
* Lastly the combines effect of temperature and wind on the ozone concentration was tested for significance.

### Achievements
*  The Model was able to uncover that there exist a highly significant and positive effect of wind and temperature on the ozone layer and a highly negative effect of the intensity of solar radiation on the ozone layer.
## Recommendation
An attempt to help sustain the concentration of the ozone layer would be to increase wind and temperature and to reduce solar radiation accordingly.
